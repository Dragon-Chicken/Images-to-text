## Images to text
A image to text program made with Python

## Python modules

## Settings
1. 'chars' is the gradient

    add a space to the start of the string

2. 'terminal' print to the terminal or not

3. 'quality' the quality of the final image

    higher is better but takes more time to generate

4. 'filepath' path to the image file

5. 'font' path to font file

    set to 'None' to use the default font

   (some fonts don't support the gradient characters)
